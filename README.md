# EX_Diwali_Sales_EDA# 🛍️ Diwali Sales Data Analysis — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📌 Project Description

This project explores and analyzes Diwali sales data using Python to derive business insights and customer behavior patterns. The analysis focuses on understanding how different factors—such as gender, age group, occupation, and state—influence purchase decisions during the festive season.

The project is structured as an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pipeline, making use of real-world sales data and presenting visual insights to assist in data-driven marketing strategies and product planning.
